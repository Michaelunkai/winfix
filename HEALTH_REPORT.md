## EVENT LOG SUMMARY (Last 7 Days)

| Log | Critical | Errors | Warnings |
|-----|----------|--------|----------|
| System | 0 | 6 | 9 |
| Application | 0 | 4 | 5 |
| **Total** | **0** | **10** | **14** |

### Notable Events
1. **Unexpected shutdown** (Event 6008) - System crashed at 5:44 PM
2. **TPM-WMI errors** (1796, 1801) - Secure Boot not enabled
3. **VSS errors** (8193) - Fixed by starting LanmanWorkstation
4. **Driver errors** - WUDFRd failed for HID devices

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### High Priority
1. **Enable Secure Boot** in BIOS to resolve TPM errors and improve security
2. **Investigate crash** - The unexpected shutdown may indicate:
   - Driver issue (WUDFRd failures noted)
   - Power delivery problem
   - Overheating (though no thermal events logged)

### Medium Priority
1. **Re-pair Bluetooth device** (68:df:e4:12:d4:ef)
2. **Update HID drivers** to fix WUDFRd errors
3. **Review startup programs** - Docker Desktop, Edge auto-launch may delay boot

### Low Priority
1. **Failed scheduled tasks** - Most are Windows maintenance tasks that may not apply
2. **Docker Desktop startup** - Consider if actually needed
